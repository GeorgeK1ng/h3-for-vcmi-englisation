He looked up, gazing into your face and passed out.  \n\nA couple of hours later, the boy revived and spoke of his time as an apprentice to the Grand Forgesmith, Khazandar.  He then spun a tale of working as a simple boy in a simple forge, when along came these mysterious people looking like fantastical creatures, who spoke in hush tones to Khazandar and the whole lot of them vanished in a puff of blue smoke.  \n\nWeeks later, he was summoned to again work for Khazandar as his primary apprentice, a great honor it was indeed.  The difference this time was the people around Khazandar were not the mysterious figures from before, but rather these people were demonic and frightening.  A tall, powerful-looking devil sneered at the boy day in and day out.  And when they had completed that which they were being forced to create, the devil, called Xeron by his minions, ordered them taken to Jagos for their execution.  Khazandar, the boy said, was taken away and the boy left to die in a cell.  He never saw him again.  After only a few days, the boy managed to escape and just now reached here.  He had heard of this pale warrior who was steadily defeating the devils these past few months and chose to seek him out.  The boy wanted to warn you of the thing that he helped to create, a weapon dubbed Armageddon's Blade.",

Should they really have Armageddon's Blade, King Lucifer must not be allowed to continue in his mad quest.  The line must be drawn here and now.\n\nSeeing as how the Erathian people see this war as being over, they have refused to fund your war any longer.

Heart is the one thing the devils cannot crush; use it as your most prominent weapon.  Good luck.  I pray you will be well, as I do for those under your command.\"  With that, Tamar vanishes as if he had never come, as if he were a mere dream.

Some came as ghosts others as visions of warning, but all pointed to one thing; he was headed down the dark path.\n\nOne of the most powerful of these dreams was a visit from a longhaired old man with long wizened features and gnarled fingers.  He spoke in the raspy voice of the dead.\n\n\"King Roland, I come to you with a tale.  'Tis a tale of vengeance and suffering, pain and loss.  I was once a mage of great repute in Bracada, but was stripped of my title of Archmage and sentenced to become just a lowly alchemist for the crime of being far too mercenary in my ways.  This, however, was where I thrived.  My skills as a weaponsmith and alchemist went unchallenged and I was hailed as a hero by some.  I made weapons for kings and priests, lords and ruffians.  Anyone and everyone with the gold could purchase my services, both on the side of light and dark.  I did not care.  But then, came Xeron and his terrible request.  He fed my greed and anger at being used and abused by those who claimed to be my superiors by giving me gold and a chance at revenge.  This burning desire blinded me to the reality that Xeron was a truly evil man and I paid for my mistake with my life and immortal soul.\n\nI stand before you now, Roland Ironfist, to make you see that you are treading down the dark path, a path that will lead you away from your loving wife and son.  Turn back now and all shall be forgiven.  Ignore my warnings and forever shall you be like your brother, Archibald.  Your innocence may be lost, but do not allow your good humor and noble heart go with it.\"\n\nThe image faded and was replaced by that of his father, old King Ironfist.  The image of his father was one long ago nearly forgotten.  It had been so many years since his beloved father had passed away.  This brought up memories of the indignities and pain he had suffered at the hands of his brother.  It also reminded him of the strength he had back then and how he persevered during the Succession Wars.  His father's countenance carried with it a look of disappointment in his noble son.  King Ironfist simply shook his head and walked away, back into the shadowy fog of death.  \n\nRoland awoke with a shot, calling out his father's name and reaching for his hand.  Realizing it had been a mere dream, he lay back down to return to sleep.  As he tried to drift back into sleep's grasp, he could not help shake the image of his father turning his back on his favored son.  Roland understood at the moment, what Khazandar's ghost and Catherine's letter had been trying to tell him.  He immediately got dressed and sought out a cleric.  He had strayed from the path of light; it was time to return to the way. ",

He nods in approval at your muscular frame, massive even by Barbarian standards.\n\n\"It's CRAG Hack,\" you snarl.  Wizards!  They think they're so smart.  Can't even get a first name right!\n\n\"I seek four items taken by some very evil men.  Individually, the items are worthless, mere tokens.  But together, they can be assembled into a great weapon, a weapon that I desperately require.\"\n\nYou spit a chicken leg at the puny magic user.  \"Why should I help you?\"\n\nSandro's eyes narrow.  \"Not only will I give you five hundred thousand gold pieces and a small land grant when you bring me these four items, but once they are assembled I will be able to destroy The Armor of the Damned, a magic artifact of unspeakable power and evil.  NOW are you interested?\"\n\nYou scratch your head in a rare contemplative moment.  Destroying anything - especially an evil magical item - appeals to your Barbarian code of ethics.  \"Do you know where these four items are?\" \n\n\"Yes, I do.  Here.\"  Sandro hands you a small map.  \"This is the land where Barshon the Barbarian lives.  He is a very evil man who has unearthed the first item I seek.  It is called the Skull Helmet.  Now, I warn you, do not listen to anything he tells you.  Although, like you, he is a Barbarian, he has no honor and lies like a snake.  Also, there are other rogue barbarians in the vicinity who will try to stop you.  This is very dangerous business, to be sure, but will you accept my offer?\"\n\nYou suddenly jump up, grab your battle-axe, and bury it into the table, inches from Sandro's clasped hands.  \"I'll do it!

It's unclear what happened.  Had Falorel been replaced by the vampire?  Was the real Falorel captured and turned into a vampire?  Or was something else going on?  And who killed the vampire?

He had practice in this before, explaining how he killed lots of Necromancers for some artifacts.  Those artifacts were supposed to be his ticket to gold, land and women.  But it never happened because Sandro cheated him out of the whole deal.  Now he just wants to kill stuff to relieve stress.

	"map.final:8.event.3.description" : "Across a small tributary of the Shandar River lies a region of Erathia that was a major hot spot during the Timber Wars.  This region was fought over and controlled by both sides many times during that time and left the place battered and beaten.  These days two warlords who claim loyalty to Erathia now control it, but Gelu tells me it is in name only.  They are under Erathia's banner because it suits them for the moment, but in reality, they are loyal to themselves alone.\n\nThe Sandals of the Saint are known to be located here, but the Helm of Heavenly Enlightenment and Celestial Necklace of Bliss are only rumored.  These people will not be interested in helping us, nor will they surrender the artifacts without a fight.

If they don't locate the pieces they were looking for, what will happen to the people of AvLee or Erathia?\n\nA dark air of foreboding washes over his pale countenance.

From all accounts we feel that his legions will swell to an insurmountable size in mere months.  You must put an end to this immediately.  Hurry in your search, for we are dead without that artifact.\"",

She once told Gelu the way she learned of Sandro's ploy, that he was using Vilmar as a puppet to control Deyja from the shadows.  This would allow him to remain in control and not be a target, a clever plan indeed.  However, he underestimated the intellect of those who he duped.  He did not count on the cunning of the one called Crag Hack or the clever mind of Gem.

He's learned the ways of battle, the ways of stealth and spying, but none of that training prepared him for the consequences of mistakes.  The day of redemption shall come one day for him, but that day is not today.  First, he must do his part in the destruction of this Sandro and his armies of the undead.  Stopping this madman will, at least in part, balance his soul against the mistakes he made and the suffering he caused when he destroyed those AvLee lords.

Finally, after a bit of water and some coaxing one of them tells the tale in a near-senseless jumble of words. \n\n \"I-I was farming and my wife was out picking berries with the children.\"  He closes his eyes to squeeze out the images and breathes deeply. \"Th-then we were beset upon by a wailing none of us had ever heard before.  Frozen in terror, I watched as these ghastly things flew towards my wife and children.\"  He sobs, unable to speak for a moment.  \"Then I ran and ran and ran.   Never looked back.  Mortimer found me two days later.  But he's dead now, or at least sort of.  He walks, but does not see or hear that we are his friends.  He killed his own son!\"  The man finally breaks down completely and sobs like a child.  This was worse, much worse.  Reports from the others confirm your worst fears.  ",

My men have confirmed news of undead overrunning the land.  Erathia is under attack by these vile creatures.  I am the only one who has answered their pleas.  I do know of the troubles you are having with this new menace, but any help would be appreciated.\"  Satisfied the message conveys the urgency of the situation you send it off, hoping the Erathians will take seriously a request for help from a Tatalian.

All of our Knights and Clerics have been called to defend Erathia from these demonic beasts.  Good luck.\"  His words are honest, but do not bode well for your cause.

There is however, one Knight whom you may be able to recruit.  He is being ransomed by a group calling themselves, \"The NightStalkers\".  If you free him and show this letter he will offer the aid you need.\"  Barely containing the burning fury welling up within, you crumple the letter and stuff it into your pocket. Abruptly, you shout orders to break camp, not saying a word about the bad news.  Your instincts tell you this is more than a mere nuisance, but fools never listen.",
	"map.fire:0.event.8.description" : "Last night you came across lots of piles of rotting flesh.  Even though they did not move you were confident it was a trap.  Rather than risking another confrontation, you loosed the full force of your Fire Magic, cleansing the area of the rotting bodies.  At first the men where horrified at the show of fiery magic.  Recoiling from your destruction of what obviously had become Zombies they stood far from you. All night your own men, fearful of your fire magic, shunned you.  In the morning black smoke plumed into the sky.  Rushing to see why the forest was burning you saw most amazing sight.  The men were grimly surrounding a pyre.  There, the bodies of the dead were being burned.  Apparently they had come to terms with fire and realized its value here.  If the bodies were not utterly destroyed then they would soon join the ranks of undead.  It was best this way.",

They are still upset at the war and are probably under attack.  Why do you bother?\" \n\n \"Well, I must try.\" A small quirky smile brushes past your face.  \"This way I have covered all of my bases.  If we fail then no one can say I should have asked for help.   What if they do not refuse?  It is a possibility I cannot pass up.  You are no warrior.  I need troops and other warriors or spell casters.  I do value your assistance, but we simply need more help.  This is not going to be an easy battle and you know it.\"  A frown settles back to its accustomed place. ",
	"map.fire:0.event.11.description" : "\"My dearest young Witch,\" you know this is going to be an 'I told you' session. \"I did warn you against begging for aid from Erathia.  Even the Tatalains are unreachable.  I am truly surprised they even took the time to write what they did-\"  \n\nYou cut him off angrily. \"Quiet!  I am the one who makes the decisions around here.  Don't give me that \"I told you so\" crap.  I am well aware of what the response was going to be.  Now I have covered my bases and we can get on with this business of burning the plague of undead from the land.\"  Unconsciously your hands have clenched and power had begun to slither out and curl around you like a snake ready to strike.  Seeing the terror in his eyes you stalk out, and curse him for getting you so angry. ",
	"map.fire:0.event.12.description" : "Baltron rushes into your tent, waking you from a near dead sleep.  \"Adrienne!  There is trouble with the men!  Come quick!\"  Throwing on clothes you stumble sleepy eyed out into camp and straight into a free for all.  Tatalians and Erathians are brawling, a huge fistfight has engulfed the camp!  \"Stop this now!\"  Your strong voice carries, but none listen.  Vainly you shout again and know it will only give you a sore throat.  From deep within you call the anger needed to release the power of Fire. \n\nUnleashing flames high into the night sky men quickly scramble for cover. Letting your temper cool, each man warily keeps their distance as you stalk through the camp, looking for the instigators.  It is easy to find them.  Two hotheaded Cavaliers were disciplined twice already for inciting the Mighty Gorgons within the ranks - by trying to ride them.  Now one of the troublemakers lies dead, having discovered why most don't lock eyes with a Mighty Gorgon.  Staring coldly at the remaining Cavalier you wordlessly snag the fool in one hand.  \n\nBetween gritted teeth you manage to speak these words, \"There - will - be - no - more - FIGHTING!\"  The camp jumps as you punctuate the last word with a small burst of fire from your free hand.  The Cavalier will need to change his shorts.  Dropping him you stalk back towards your tent.  Baltron takes over, scolding them further and arranging for healing of the wounded and burial of the dead.  ",
	"map.fire:0.event.13.description" : "It has been a long and tiring day.  Traveling through familiar territory that has been turned into a pile of rotting corpses takes it toll on everyone.  Sighing heavily you retire to your simple tent to find a few hours of sleep.  Noticing the flap is open you cautiously enter, wondering if undead understand the notion of assassins.  If they do you were not going to find the answer today.  Dozens of flowers litter the inside of the tent, their sweet perfume a heavenly scent.  You breathe deeply and realize this is not something soldiers or Baltron would do.  Giggling from just outside the door lets you know who is responsible for such a gesture.  Children, recently rescued are watching you enjoy the simple pleasure of flowers amidst the horrors of war.  You toss them a smile and shoo them off to bed.  For that night, at least, you sleep well and dream only of your childhood.",

This power behind this menace is yet unknown, but you suspect it is greater than the leaders of Erathia have guessed.  Tatalia needs to be warned to support Erathia if it falls.  Pushing aside the thoughts of yet another war you look forward to simply going home.  ",

Those Death Knights and Necromancers seen here used to be living members of a cult that served Lord Haart.  From Erathia it has been confirmed - Lord Haart was raised from the dead.  He then raised the dead members of his cult who now serve him with utter loyalty.  He is a force of death moving through a land of great life.",

It seems the Death Knight had an ingenious thought.  His troops were left to guard the dwellings of all citizens of Tatalia.  When the new recruits, ready to fight for Tatalia emerged each week, the undead were to attack.  Powerful magicks were placed so if a group of undead simply stayed in the area, their numbers would cause the fallen Tatalians to rise from the dead and join the ranks of the enemy.  With this tactic the Death Knight's armies will swell each week, and soon be unstoppable.  The next few scouts reported this tactic as being used in a widespread manner.  The undead must be cleared from the land and the Tatalians freed from their bony grasp. ",

Instead of getting a sailing ship, they got a dinghy for short distance traveling. The crewmembers began to wonder what kind of bet Sir Christian had lost. On the clear nights he used the stars to navigate his craft. But still had no idea where they were heading. After several days, scurvy, horrendous body odor, and severe sunburn one of the crewmembers spotted a small island flying a purple flag. The weak vessel held up well for most of the journey but was really beginning to take a beating from the rough ocean waters. Sir Christian decided to land his galley before it sank right from under his feet. Once ashore he met with the leader of the village to learn they were the world famous Regnan Pirates in charge of smuggling stolen loot to between Erathia and Enroth. Sir Christian explained his situation to the leader of the village who then agreed to help him in one condition: Sir Christian would have to swear undying loyalty to the pirates and complete secrecy to their operation. The alternative was to get the comfy chair. After a moment of thought and consideration, Sir Christian came to the conclusion that he had no choice and joined the pirates. From the sound of it he didn't want to know what the comfy chair is. The pirates would help Sir Christian after he completed a small quest.

On of the women winks at you, touches your lips with her finger, then touches her own lips. They turn and walk away. You have never seen such a beautiful sight.  Your hands become clammy and you experience a feeling that you have never felt before. \"This must be love!\" you shout.

I wear these earplugs to keep the nasty bugs out of my ears. So, what were you saying? \nYou stand there and just stare at her amazing beauty while panicking about to say you try desperately to think of another one of those great lines from that book. \n\"How about going out with a guy who doesn't have the plague for a change?\"\nShe folds her arms and glares at you. You start blushing and become uneasy. In a last ditch effort to strike up conversation you try another one.\n\"Uh...Want some jerky?\"\n\"You Pervert!

Suddenly a Leprechaun jumps out of the forest and sits on the lid, not letting you open it.  Not really understanding what just happened and having never before seen a leprechaun you just sit there and study him.  After a few long moments he breaks the silence, \"I am Erik!

Your mother enrolled you in the magic academy at a young age, but as much as you tried to fulfill her wish for you to grow up to become Wizard, you found academy life to be excruciatingly boring.  In many ways you were more like your father, spending your time engaged in swordplay rather than studying your magic textbooks.  To your teacher's dismay, your studies suffered as your fighting skills grew.  However, the more the academy attempted to discipline you, the more you came to hate magic and yearn for a more adventurous life.\n\nSuch a life always seemed out of your grasp until last week, when you received an invitation from Winston Boragus, the Duke of Krewlod, to join his armed forces.  Your reputation as a swordsman had reached the neighboring country of Krewlod, and the Duke, who desperately needed to supplement his armed forces, was aggressively seeking foreign recruits.  You saw this opportunity as a sign that now was the time for you to give up your life of magic.\n\nKnowing how zealously the academy guards its secrets, you are certain they will close the borders and give you chase.  Undaunted, you send one of your sparring partners out find a town where you could build up troops to help you fight your way to Krewlod.  Last night your friend sent word of a town not far from Calarnen.  All you have to do is follow the road south, and you would get to safety in a few days.",

She apparently knew that I was scouting for her and used magic to avoid detection.  The only useful thing my scouts had to report was that all of Bracada's cities were preparing for a war.  I don't want to spend any more time in my former homeland than necessary, so I will send out my scouts out again to locate Beleg and Orruk.",
