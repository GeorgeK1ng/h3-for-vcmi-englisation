The two lords of Shireton, the Guardians as they are called, are rumored to have sided with the denizens of The Underworld against the King.  You must go and confirm this vile rumor.

Masked men came charging into your room and proceeded to hack the bed, sheets, pillows, blankets, spread and bed curtains to pieces.  While they were killing the bed, you tiptoed out of the room, past the wounded guard by the door, and ran for the nearest guardroom.  From there you had the guard turn out and attack the assassins.  At the end of the night the score was one bed for them, seven assassins for you.",

He was the \"One\" responsible for all the \"Assassinations\".  He was running his \"Operation\" from his secret headquarters located in the castle \"Outhouse\".

The four guards with you tried to break the door down, but instead knocked the whole outhouse over. His sanctuary gone, Cough-mumble-mumble sprang at you and tried to strangle you.  The Captain knocked him off of you then Dorie tripped him and old Cough-mumble-mumble fell down the shaft of the pit toilet and drowned before anyone could fish him out.
